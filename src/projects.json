        "itemContent": "The digital transformation of the antibiogram test now allows for its application beyond the confines of microbiology labs. This workshop presents an engaging chance for attendees to enhance their comprehension of antibiotics and their resistance. Moreover, it provides an array of hands-on activities, enabling participants to gain practical insight into the test. The workshop is designed to foster a profound respect for the crucial role antibiotics play in our everyday health and the challenges posed by resistance. Through this experience, participants will expand their understanding of antibiotics and their resistance, exploring the vital function these critical medications perform in contemporary healthcare. The project is inserted in MAKEAWARE! a research project on Antimicrobial Resistance. AMR occurs when organisms no longer respond to treatments, making infections hard to cure. Superbugs could cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050. Scientific research is important, but citizens' active cooperation is crucial. This project aims to engage young people in the fight against AMR through an interactive experience to raise awareness. Thanks to the project high school students can experience the procedure of studying antibiotic resistance against bacteria without being in a laboratory. All the information are represented in the productâ€™s display and the smartphone. In particular on the smartphone are displayed all the instructions for the usage of the product and on the DiPLab Petri are shown the results of the experiment. The context is actually Microbiology in general and specifically the issue of Antimicrobial Resistance. Microbiology is one of the main areas of interest in studying the microorganisms that have been with us since the beginning. Most of the resources related to the subject are hard to read and understand.",

        "itemContent": "C-UBI is a game involving two or more players. Born as a reinterpretation of the classic hide-and-seek, it is based on small cubes and integrates sound as a means of support to the finding. One player hides one cube, the other player/s must find it following the sound that the hidden cube emits. The game is timed, whoever finds the hidden cube first wins. In case time runs out before the cube is found, the hidden cube will emit a constant sound so that it can be found easily. Users are guided in the use of the game by to two displays, one for each cube, which progressively give instructions to them. Once the main cube is hidden, players must make use of both sight and hearing to find the hidden cube. In the main cube, in fact, a buzzer is inserted, which progressively emits 'beep' sounds, closer and closer together over time. The player's display, once the game has started, shows the countdown within which players can find the hidden cube. If no player finds the cube, the cube itself will emit a constant sound so that it will be easily found. C-UBI is a multi-player game that, using two or more cubes, engage the senses of both sight and hearing to find the hidden cube. There is only one switch on the cubes to turn them on. Information and countdown are presented to users through two displays, one per each cube. All other dynamics are activated by the players through by moving closer or apart the cubes. C-UBI has in fact a system of magnetic sensors that ensure that the different phases of the game are activated following the user's action. Intuitive drawings on one side of the cubes make it easy for players to understand how to trigger the game.",
